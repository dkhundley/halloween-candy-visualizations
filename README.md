# Halloween Candy Data Visualizations!
In this brief repository, I thought it would be fun to engage in the spirit of Halloween to create a special project where we create **data visualizations with a halloween candy dataset**! Pretty much the entire project resides within the singular Jupyter notebook under the `notebooks/` directory. Of course, all credit goes to FiveThirtyEight for curating this dataset in the first place and kindly putting it on Kaggle. To learn more about the dataset we'll be using, please [check out this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking) with details about the dataset on Kaggle.

Happy Halloween, friends! ðŸŽƒ
